#### Assignment (Array of frames)

Consider a typical graphical user interface (GUI). Programms are displayed within rectangular screen areas (called Windows) and are manipulated by the user by moving around a mouse cursor. When the user clicks the mouse button we want to know which program is below the mouse cursor position.

For this implement a class  `Window`. This class manages the position (x,y) and size (width, height) of a rectangle in a two dimensional coordinate space. Additionally the class shall store the name of the programm.

- Define class, instance variables and constructor.
  Define an array of 7 `Window` Objects.
- Write a method `isHit` that gets *(x,y)* coordinates and checks whether this point is inside the rectangle. 
- Let the user enter *(x,y)​* coordinates, then print out the program name if there is a window at this position.
