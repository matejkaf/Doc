Hello friend, I am Mr.Ibrahim Humaid, I work at a bank. I found your information from a business contact when I was searching for a honest partner, I hope that you will not expose or betray this trust. I am in need of your help as a foreigner to claim an abandon fund sum of $15 million U.S dollars. This money belonged to one of our customers from Thailand who died 26 December 2004 in Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami while on vacation with his family. Unfortunately his beneficiaries also passed in the tragic disaster. We currently do not have anyone to claim the funds.

Please I would like you to keep this proposal between us. My proposal is that, you will have 40% of the above mentioned fund, while will have 60%. If you are interested kindly fill out below information and send it back to me for more details.

Your full name.
Your country.
Your age.
Your occupation.
Your Phone number.
Your address.
A copy of your passport or ID card.

Regards,

Mr.Ibrahim Humaid.
