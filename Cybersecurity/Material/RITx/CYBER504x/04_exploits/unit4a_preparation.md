### ACTIVITY PREPARATION

**Getting help:** If you have trouble with these activities, please ask questions in the “Troubleshooting” forum in *General Class Discussions*. While we will be following this forum, if you can help out your fellow learners, please feel free to address their questions.

**Remember:** Watch these Demo videos before trying the activities. Seeing me complete the activity first will help you understand each of the steps.

**System:** During these activities, you’ll use the Kali VM as you did in the packet sniffing exercises in Unit 1.

**Note:**

- To complete all of these activities as written, in sequence, you need to have, or acquire, your own copy of Windows XP.
- Just the very last activity requires Windows 7. If you're using the free Microsoft Windows 7 VM (which is limited), some Meterpreter commands from the Meterpreter Activity and Demo Videos will not work. If you're using your own Windows 7 copy, you should be able to replicate everything I did in the demos.

#### Software and Downloads

**Software:** In these activities you will use these applications and resources that are included in the Kali VM:

- **Metasploit Framework** contains a large public database and framework of over 1600 quality-assured exploits and close to 500 payloads, which explains its name.
- **Meterpreter**, Metasploit’s most popular payload, allows you to upload and download files to and from a victim system, take screenshots, collect password hashes, take over the screen, mouse, and keyboard, and even turn on a webcam! Metasploit also contains nearly 50 encoders, which are used to transform the payload to fool antivirus software and IDSes, as well as remove “bad characters” that would crash a target program or system.
- **PostgreSQL** (pronounced "post-gress-Q-L") is an open source relational DBMS (database management system) used by Metasploit.
- **msfconsole** is the most popular interface to the Metasploit Framework. It’s an “all-in-one” centralized console that allows you to efficiently access the MSF options.

#### Downloads

You’ll need a Windows 7 system. It can be your host machine, or another device altogether. If neither of those conditions are possible, you can download a free legal Windows 7 VM. In your hypervisor, you might need to add the Network Adapter before starting the VM.
