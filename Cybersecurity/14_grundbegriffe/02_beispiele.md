#### Marriott International

**Date:** 2014–2018
**Impact:** 500 million customers
**Details:** In November 2018, Marriott International announced that cyber thieves had stolen data on approximately **500 million customers**. The breach actually occurred on systems supporting Starwood hotel brands starting in 2014. The attackers remained in the system after Marriott acquired Starwood in 2016 and were not discovered until September 2018.

For some of the victims, only name and contact information were compromised. The attackers were able to take some combination of contact info, **passport number**, Starwood Preferred Guest numbers, travel information, and other personal information. Marriott believes that **credit card numbers** and expiration dates of more than 100 million customers were stolen, although the company is uncertain whether the attackers were able to decrypt the credit card numbers.
