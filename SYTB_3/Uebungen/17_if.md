Aufgaben:

-   Ein Directory anlegen wenn dieses nicht existiert.
-   Create a Bash script which will take 2 numbers as command line arguments. It will print to the screen the larger of the two numbers.
-   Create a Bash script which will print a message based upon which day of the week it is (eg. 'Happy hump day' for Wedensday, 'TGIF' for Friday etc).
